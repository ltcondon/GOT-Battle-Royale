# Summary

The game is one-player, wherein the user firsts chooses their character from four possible Game Of Thrones favorites. The user then battles unchosen characters in an order of their choosing. The strategic component lies in thoughtfully fighting opponents with lower "attack power" and/or "health points" first so the player may gain power before taking on stronger opponents.

## Technology

The game's logic is composed primarily of vanilla javascript with a few jQuery components also implemented. Only one HTML file is referenced, and the styling is a mix of internal CSS, Bootstrap, Google Fonts and Animate.css.

## Current State

At the time of writing the 'attack' functionality is ncomplete but nearly at a playable state. The game's aesthetic is entirely configured.
